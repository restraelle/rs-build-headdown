                <p>
                  You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of
                  delivery for a full refund except for firearms. We'll also pay
                  the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our
                  error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of
                  giving your package to the return shipper, however, in many
                  cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period
                  includes the transit time for us to receive your return from
                  the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to
                  process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days),
                  and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request
                  (5 to 10 business days).

                  We can ship to virtually any address in the world. Note that
                  there are restrictions on some products, and some products
                  cannot be shipped to international destinations outside of the
                  United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you place an order, we will estimate shipping and
                  delivery dates for you based on the availability of your items
                  and the shipping options you choose. Depending on the shipping
                  provider you choose, shipping date estimates may appear on the
                  shipping quotes page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please also note that the shipping rates for many items we
                  sell are weight-based. The weight of any such item can be
                  found on its detail page. To reflect the policies of the
                  shipping companies we use, all weights will be rounded up to
                  the next full pound.

                  is a license in the United States that enables an individual
