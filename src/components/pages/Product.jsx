                            <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. You can do anything your heart can imagine. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.</p>
                            <p>We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's have a happy little tree in here. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>

                            <h1>I'm here for you.</h1>
                            <p>These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In life you need colors. Very easy to work these to death. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Poor old tree.</p>
                            <p>This piece of canvas is your world. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.</p>

                            <h1>Choose a platform</h1>
                            <p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.</p>
